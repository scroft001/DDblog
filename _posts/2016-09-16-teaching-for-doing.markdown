Once upon a time I was a pre-med student and one of the things we were taught was that in order to master a skill you must watch one, do one, and teach one. This can be applied to so many of the areas of study that take place in an engineering or medical environment. Coding is no different. I took my turn at professional developing after completing the college experience. It was great being able to create things from scratch, peek behind the curtain of the professional stage, and ship something that millions of people saw. Okay maybe not millions but several people saw them!

I am now in the teaching space and it is very clear that I learned more from the doing step then I did from the actual learning step. The rigid structure of deadlines and payouts is not the most conducive place to learn new skills, but it is undoubtedly the place where learning is most often taking place. We need this thing to do this other thing that we have partially built but it doesn’t work. Can you fix it by the 15th to ship with the new product? I have never seen this thing, I have never coded that functionality, and the previous developer didn’t comment anything and I have no idea what he was trying to accomplish. Sure, let me learn all these tools to ship this specific functionality. And we do! We scramble and learn extremely quickly and those skills often stick and can be applied to other problems.

Our teachers in those cases are Stack Overflow and GitHub, even just a wild phone call to someone who may have run into this once. These frantic searches are not the most in-depth looks at the topic but they can get the job done and are often useful in future development. Teaching for doing in a classroom setting is not always about conveying the why but more about explaining the how, especially to kids.

If the how is explained in a sufficient manner the skill can be applied to other problems. Just as our scrambling taught us how to make that feature work. The beauty of being in a teaching environment is that you can answer the questions that come with the missing why. The student does not need to know exactly why the browser renders that piece of script the way it does, just how it interacts with the rest of the code and how it is actually presented when the user clicks go.

Teaching code, in my opinion, needs to be presented in a practical sense. Show them how to do that really cool thing this code can do. Don’t bog them down in the why. to start, get them building and their curiosity will steer them towards the relevant why.
